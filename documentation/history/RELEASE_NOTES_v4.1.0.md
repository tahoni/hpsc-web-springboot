# 🧾 Release Notes – Version 4.1.0

**Status:** ✨ Stable

---

## 📖 Overview

This release adds core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities and supporting improvements for the
refactored IPSC domain introduced in version 4.0.0.

---

## ⭐ Key Highlights

### 🛠️ CRUD Operations for IPSC Entities

- **IpscMatch CRUD:** Complete create, read, update, delete support for IPSC match entities
- **IpscMatchStage CRUD:** Full CRUD support for match stage entities
- **Repository implementation:** New `IpscMatchRepository` and `IpscMatchStageRepository` with CRUD methods
- **Service layer:** Corresponding service methods for all CRUD operations
- **Transactional handling:** Transaction management for all write operations ensuring data integrity

### ✅ Enhanced Input Validation

- **DTO Validation:** Additional `@NotNull` annotations on critical DTO fields
- **Bean Validation:** Jakarta Validation annotations integrated throughout request/response DTOs
- **Error Messages:** Detailed validation error reporting for better API usability

### 🧪 Testing Improvements

- **Unit Tests:** Added comprehensive unit tests for CRUD endpoints
- **Integration Tests:** Extended integration tests for service behaviour validation
- **Error Cases:** Test coverage for validation failures and edge cases

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **No new breaking changes:** Previous breaking changes from v4.0.0 (e.g., `Match` → `IpscMatch`) remain in
  effect
- **Full backward compatibility:** With v4.0.0 implementations

---

## 🔧 Technical Enhancements

- CRUD endpoints and service operations were added for IPSC entities
- Improved request validation on create/update DTOs
- Transactional handling was added for create/update/delete operations to ensure data integrity
- Reused existing domain initialisation logic (`init()` methods) for entity creation
- Enhanced DTO validation and null-safety for CRUD flows
- Added unit and integration tests covering CRUD endpoints and service behaviour
- API docs updated to include CRUD operations and request/response schemas

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed edge cases in entity initialisation when creating stages with missing `maxPoints`
- Resolved mapping issues between DTOs and domain entities during updates

---

## 🔗 API Changes

- Request/response DTOs updated to include all necessary fields for create/update flows

---

## 📦 Migration Guide

### 📋 Migration Notes

- **Database schema:** Ensure tables `ipsc_match` and `ipsc_match_stage` are present
- **Foreign-key constraints:** Review cascade behavior for delete operations to avoid accidental data loss
- **Repositories/services:** Continue using new repository interfaces from v4.0.0
- **Test fixtures:** Integration tests may require test data fixtures for create/update flows

---
